Argo
====

An RDF manipulation, parsing and serialisation library, written in Go.

Also contains (currently WIP) support for the Kasabi API.

Important!
==========

This library is written for the LibGo implementation distributed with GCCGO v4.6.1.
Therefore, it may fail to compile if you are using a newer (or older) implementation.

A word about API keys
=====================

In order for the test programs to work, a valid API key needs to be placed in a file named "apikey.txt" in the current directory.
